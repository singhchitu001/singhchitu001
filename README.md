 👋 Hello World, I'm Chitu

💻 Developer | 🤖 Bot Builder | ⚙️ Automation Enthusiast | 🧠 Logic First Thinker

Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I’m a self-driven developer from India who believes in the power of code as a tool for freedom, efficiency, and creativity. Whether it’s solving repetitive problems, building scalable systems, or simply experimenting with new tech — I’m always looking for ways to make machines work smarter so that humans don’t have to.

🚀 My Journey So Far

My journey into programming wasn’t born from textbooks — it came from curiosity. I’ve always been fascinated by how things work under the hood: how apps communicate, how data flows, how logic controls behavior, and how a few lines of code can automate hours of manual effort.

Over time, I’ve built projects that started out of need — Telegram bots to automate alerts, small web tools to manage community data, PHP/JS scripts to make repetitive tasks disappear. Every project has been a learning experience, and every bug has been a stepping stone.

My approach is simple: build with purpose, optimize with logic, and scale with simplicity.

⚒️ What I Work With

I don't chase trends — I choose tools that solve problems:

Languages: Python, PHP, JavaScript (Node & vanilla)

Frameworks/Libraries: Flask, Express.js, Telegram Bot API, jQuery

Databases: MySQL, SQLite, Firebase (light use)

Tools & Tech: Linux, Git, VS Code, cPanel, cronjobs, REST APIs

Misc: Google Sheets scripts, Excel automation, WhatsApp/Telegram group management tools


Currently, I’m experimenting more with AI integrations, building secure backends, and writing bots that interact with real-time data.

🧠 Core Interests

Automation: Why do a task twice when you can script it?

Cybersecurity: I enjoy studying how systems can be both broken and protected.

Community tech: Building tools that help people — especially for campaigns, recruitment, or social causes.

Ethical coding: Using skills to solve problems, not create them.

Minimalism: Clean code is powerful code.

📌 Featured Projects

Telegram Bot Network: Built multiple bots for announcements, data collection, threaded responses, and group management — integrated with web panels and APIs.

RTI Support Tools: Scripts that help users file and track RTIs, with legal guidance and formatting assistance.

Group Access Systems: Web-based district-wise group validation tool to allow access only to verified users — with phone number and roll number cross-verification.

Job Campaign Infrastructure: Backend scripts and frontend templates to support community-led awareness campaigns (Twitter automation, post scheduling, analytics dashboards).


🎯 My Goals

Create open-source tools that are actually used by people.

Contribute to automation frameworks for social accountability and transparency.

Get better at writing clean, documented, and testable code.

Learn and apply ethical hacking concepts to secure the tools I build.

Collaborate with developers and changemakers who care about impact over hype.


🗣️ My Philosophy

> "Write code that respects time — yours and others'."



I believe that a developer isn’t someone who just writes code. A real developer listens to problems, understands the environment, and designs sustainable systems that solve and serve. It’s not just about functions and loops — it’s about responsibility and creativity.

Every script I write carries a purpose. Whether it’s to inform, protect, simplify, or scale — it must do something meaningful. That’s how I define success.


📬 Let’s Connect

If you’ve made it this far, thank you! I’d love to collaborate on useful tools, campaign tech, backend automation, or just discuss an idea. You can:

Open an issue or pull request on any of my projects

Ping me via GitHub Discussions or Telegram (if we’ve connected there)

Or just fork something and build — I’m happy to see others improve on my work
